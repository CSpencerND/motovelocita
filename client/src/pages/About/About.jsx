                                I will work on your bike as if it were my own by
                                choosing the best parts for your desired outcome
                                - often using manufacturer spec parts.

                                honest and straightforward. Iâ€™m happy to answer
                                any questions you may have.

                            <p>
                                I am the owner, operator, and face behind
                                Velocita. I began my mechanical career working
                                on cars: the first car I owned was hit and
                                "totaled," so I learned to fix it myself and was
                                hooked on wrenching.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Later, I went to school to work on race cars and
                                then fell in love with motorcycles. Since then,
                                I have worked on street bikes and race bikes at
                                both independent performance shops and
                                dealerships.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I have experience in all aspects of the
                                industry: service, parts, sales, technician, and
                                management.
                            </p>
